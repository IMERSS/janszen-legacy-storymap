## Project Summary

Harvey Janszen (July 11, 1946–May 10, 2021) was an accomplished amateur botanist and naturalist endeared to many in British Columbia's natural history community. During his career as a botanist, Harvey collected over 3,000 vascular plant specimens, mostly from the southern Gulf Islands of British Columbia, and also curated comprehensive species checklists documenting the flora of the southern Gulf Islands, Saanich Peninsula, the San Juan Islands, and various other localities throughout the Salish Sea.

## History of collection activities

Chronicling this legacy, Harvey left behind field journals documenting his collection activities throughout the region, from 1973 to 2017. Many of these important historical baseline records have not been digitized and so remain unavailable to the scientific community. Through the Janszen Legacy Project, we are actively digitizing these records, including herbarium specimens, list records, and field notes. Just before Harvey passed away, he reached out to numerous botanists in the broader community to invite their review of the comprehensive species lists he had dedicated his life to compiling for the region. Today, we are honouring his last request by seeing through this work. In the following maps, we provide a summary of the progress of this initiative to date, with reference to the journals and species list that Harvey left us with.

## Proposed project outcomes

Harvey's dataset establishes a critical baseline record of the vascular plant diversity of the southern Gulf Islands, Saanich Peninsula, and San Juans, which is vital for conservation, for our general understanding of the floristics of the region, and for the future understanding of ecological change. 

Through this initiative, together we are carrying on Harvey's legacy:

* Curating and publishing comprehensive species lists for the southern Gulf Islands, San Juan islands, the Saanich Peninsula and surounding islets

* Digitizing, imaging, and depositing Harvey's last vascular plant specimens in research collections at UBC

* Reviewing, digitizing and imaging specimens previously deposited and accessioned in collections at the Royal BC Museum and UBC Herbarium

* Digitizing Harvey's journals, including list records and field observations

* Curating this dataset to DarwinCore standards for publication in an open access data depository

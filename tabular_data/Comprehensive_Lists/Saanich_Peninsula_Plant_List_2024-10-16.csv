Coult. & Rose of 1900  is an illegitimate name because of the publication of the 1840 name.  The latter name is referential to our C. pacificum. (DG); while both Bray and Chamisso & Schlechtendal thought they were describing the same plant as Gmelin's pre-Linnaean phrase name, neither were... Bray's plant is from Latvia, C&S's is from the Bering coast of Alaska, and Gmelin's ""in omni Sibiria crescens"". (C&S's name is also illegitimate, for a separate reason than Coulter & Rose's.) Interestingly, the most recent (2003) revision of Conioselinum does (as David mentioned) dramatically expand C. tataricum from central Asia to include both Bray's and Gmelin's concept. That paper also calls our plants C. chinense, but as they really only focus on Eurasia they appear to be parroting Mathias and Constance's treatment in the vol 28 of the North American Flora (1944-1945). Cronquist's criticisms (Vasc Plants PNW vol 3, 1961) appear completely justified, and the M&C measurements appear to be based almost exclusively on Pacific material (their seed size figures exclude those for New England material given by Cronquist). The M&C treatment was prepared while Mathias was still at Berkeley with Constance, and it's entirely possible that they had insufficient material of C. chinense sensu stricto from New England. The 2003 paper does not cite Cronquist.","TL, AS, AJW, DG",complete,remaining
